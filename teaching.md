## MGT 124 Production/Operations Management

### Quality Management

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/dpmo_6sigma" target="_blank"> Six Sigma Simulator (DPMO) </a>
This simulator helps visualize how process variation and specification limits affect quality performance and defect rates in a production process.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/failure_rate_simulator.html" target="_blank"> Failure Rate Estimator </a>
This estimator visualizes the process of estimating the failure rate (i.e., the speed at which an object decays) of a product. The example uses light bulbs. 

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_chart" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

- <a href="https://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_charts_xr/" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar and R Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar and R chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean and standard deviation is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

### Process Analysis

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/flowchart_tool.html" target="_blank">Flow Chart Tool</a>
A flowchart is a visual diagram, widely used in process analysis, design, and improvement, that represents the sequence of steps, decisions, and actions within a process using standardized symbols.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/littles_law_simulator.html" target="_blank">Supply- and Demand- Constrained Process </a>
Based on Little’s Law, this simulator demonstrates how inventory levels (or service backlogs) change when the supply and demand flow rates are not aligned.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/process_capacity_tool.html" target="_blank">Process Capacity Analysis Tool </a>
This process capacity analysis tool illustrates that overall capacity is governed by the pace of the bottleneck workstation. For the purpose of teaching, although the visualization depicts an initially empty process flow, the dashboard metrics are calculated under steady-state operating conditions.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/automation_diagnostics.html" target="_blank">Automation Vulnerability Diagnostic Test </a>
This diagnostic test tool assesses how vulnerable a service process can be based on three areas of diagnosis: repetitiveness, standardizability, and divisibility of the tasks. It visualizes the result using a spider web diagram.


- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/inventory_visualization.html" target="_blank">Inventory Buildup Simulation </a> This is an Inventory Accumulation Visualizer, a simulation tool that demonstrates how inventory builds up when supply and demand rates differ.

### Location & Layout Problems

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com//downloads/csufresno/om/gravity_center.html" target="_blank"> Center of Gravity Locator </a> This interactive study tool assists in identifying the gravity center based on the specified target locations. Additionally, it displays nearby cities as potential candidates for logistics center locations. 

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com//downloads/csufresno/om/tsp_visualizer.html" target="_blank"> Traveling Sales Person Problem </a> This visualization tool demonstrates how to plan an efficient travel route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point. It helps users understand routing efficiency and how total travel distance can be reduced through better sequencing. 

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com//downloads/csufresno/om/qap-demo-tool.html" target="_blank"> Quadratic Assignment Problem </a> This interactive tool explores how to assign departments or facilities to locations in a way that minimizes overall movement (therefore, communication cost). It helps visualize how layout decisions affect total efficiency in a workspace or production system.

### Lean Philosophy
- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com//downloads/csufresno/om/5s_weekly_report.html" target="_blank"> 5S Weekly Report & Checklist </a> This tool allows students to generate a 5S activity report. They can report their actions, their feelings about the results, and their overall progress in implementing the 5S principles. The report can be saved in PDF format. 

### Misc. Topics

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/contribution-margin-calc.html" target="_blank"> Multiproduct Contribution Margin Ratio Calculator </a> This interactive study tool helps calculate the weighted contribution ratio when multiple products or product categories are involved.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/summation.html" target="_blank"> Studying Summation Symbols </a> This interactive study component explains the summation symbol - Sigma. It explains the core building blocks, common examples, and even study quizzes.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/job_shop_simulator.html" target="_blank"> Job Shop Scheduling </a> This tool illustrates the intricacies of a job shop environment by demonstrating how delays can occur when products with varying task sequences enter the queue. Careful planning of the facility layout and strategic task sequencing can mitigate these issues. 

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/dea_visualizer.html" target="_blank"> DEA Visualizer </a> An interactive educational tool that visualizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) - a method for identifying which organizations (hospitals, schools, stores, etc.) operate most efficiently by plotting them on a graph where the "efficiency frontier" shows best performers and highlights which units are underperforming relative to their peers.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/diminishing_returns_demo.html" target="_blank"> Diminishing Marginal Productivity </a> This is an interactive tool that demonstrates the economic concept of diminishing marginal productivity through real-world scenarios, showing how adding more resources (workers, study time, etc.) eventually leads to smaller increases in output.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/downloads/csufresno/om/forecasting_tool.html" target="_blank"> Forecasting Tools </a> This is an interactive tool that demonstrates five forecasting techniques in operations management through Central Valley scenarios, showing how different methods (Naive, Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Trend Projection) perform with various data patterns.
