### Location & Layout Problems

- <a href="http://wentoday.com//download/csufresno/om/gravity_center.html" target="_blank"> Center of Gravity Locator </a> This interactive study tool assists in identifying the gravity center based on the specified target locations. Additionally, it displays nearby cities as potential candidates for logistics center locations. 

- <a href="http://wentoday.com//download/csufresno/om/tsp_visualizer.html" target="_blank"> Traveling Sales Person Problem </a> This visualization tool demonstrates how to plan an efficient travel route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point. It helps users understand routing efficiency and how total travel distance can be reduced through better sequencing. 

- <a href="http://wentoday.com//download/csufresno/om/qap-demo-tool.html" target="_blank"> Quadratic Assignment Problem </a> This interactive tool explores how to assign departments or facilities to locations in a way that minimizes overall movement (therefore, communication cost). It helps visualize how layout decisions affect total efficiency in a workspace or production system. 


### Quality Management

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/dpmo_6sigma" target="_blank"> Six Sigma Simulator (DPMO) </a>
This simulator helps visualize how process variation and specification limits affect quality performance and defect rates in a production process.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/failure_rate_simulator.html" target="_blank"> Failure Rate Estimator </a>
This estimator visualies the process of estimating the failure rate (i.e., the speed at which an object decays) of a product. The example uses light bulbs. 

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_chart" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

- <a href="https://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_charts_xr/" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar and R Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar and R chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean and standard deviation is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

### Process Analysis

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/flowchart_tool.html" target="_blank">Flow Chart Tool</a>
A flowchart is a visual diagram, widely used in process analysis, design, and improvement, that represents the sequence of steps, decisions, and actions within a process using standardized symbols.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/littles_law_simulator.html" target="_blank">Supply- and Demand- Constrained Process </a>
Based on Little’s Law, this simulator demonstrates how inventory levels (or service backlogs) change when the supply and demand flow rates are not aligned.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/process_capacity_tool.html" target="_blank">Process Capacity Analysis Tool </a>
This process capacity analysis tool illustrates that overall capacity is governed by the pace of the bottleneck workstation. For the purpose of teaching, although the visualization depicts an initially empty process flow, the dashboard metrics are calculated under steady-state operating conditions.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/automation_diagnostics.html" target="_blank">Automation Vulnerability Diagnostic Test </a>
This diagnostic test tool assesses how vulnerable a service process can be based on three areas of diagnosis: repetitiveness, standardizability, and divisibility of the tasks. It visualizes the result using a spider web diagram. 

### Lean Philosophy
- 5S



### Misc. Topics

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/contribution-margin-calc.html" target="_blank"> Multiproduct Contribution Margin Ratio Calculator </a> This interactive study tool helps calculate the weighted contribution ratio when multiple products or product categories are involved.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/summation.html" target="_blank"> Studying Summation Symbols </a> This interactive study component explains the summation symbol - Sigma. It explains the core building blocks, common examples, and even study quizzes.
