### Misc. 

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/summation.html" target="_blank"> Studying Summation Symbols </a> This interactive study component explains the summation symbol - Sigma. It explains the core building blocks, common examples, and even study quizzes. 


### Quality Management

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/dpmo_6sigma" target="_blank"> Six Sigma Simulator (DPMO) </a>
This simulator helps visualize how process variation and specification limits affect quality performance and defect rates in a production process.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/failure_rate_simulator.html" target="_blank"> Failure Rate Estimator </a>
This estimator visualies the process of estimating the failure rate (i.e., the speed at which an object decays) of a product. The example uses light bulbs. 

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_chart" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

- <a href="https://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_charts_xr/" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar and R Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar and R chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean and standard deviation is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

### Process Analysis

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/flowchart_tool.html" target="_blank">Flow Chart Tool</a>
A flowchart is a visual diagram, widely used in process analysis, design, and improvement, that represents the sequence of steps, decisions, and actions within a process using standardized symbols.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/littles_law_simulator.html" target="_blank">Supply- and Demand- Constrained Process </a>
Based on Littleâ€™s Law, this simulator demonstrates how inventory levels (or service backlogs) change when the supply and demand flow rates are not aligned.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/process_capacity_tool.html" target="_blank">Process Capacity Analysis Tool </a>
This process capacity analysis tool illustrates that overall capacity is governed by the pace of the bottleneck workstation. For the purpose of teaching, although the visualization depicts an initially empty process flow, the dashboard metrics are calculated under steady-state operating conditions.

- <a href="http://www.wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/automation_diagnostics.html" target="_blank">Automation Vulnerability Diagnostic Test </a>
This diagnostic test tool assesses how vulnerable a service process can be based on three areas of diagnosis: repetitiveness, standardizability, and divisibility of the tasks. It visualizes the result using a spider web diagram.
