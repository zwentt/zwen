### Quality Management

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/dpmo_6sigma" target="_blank"> Six Sigma Simulator (DPMO) </a>
This simulator helps visualize how process variation and specification limits affect quality performance and defect rates in a production process.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/failure_rate_simulator.html" target="_blank"> Failure Rate Estimator </a>
This estimator visualies the process of estimating the failure rate (i.e., the speed at which an object decays) of a product. The example uses light bulbs. 

- <a href="http://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_chart" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

- <a href="https://zwen.shinyapps.io/control_charts_xr/" target="_blank"> Control Chart (X-bar and R Chart) Simulator </a>
The X-bar and R chart helps you quickly see whether your process mean and standard deviation is stable (in control) or unstable (out of control).

### Process Analysis

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/flowchart_tool.html" target="_blank">Flow Chart Tool</a>
A flowchart is a visual diagram, widely used in process analysis, design, and improvement, that represents the sequence of steps, decisions, and actions within a process using standardized symbols.

- <a href="http://wentoday.com/download/csufresno/om/littles_law_simulator.html" target="_blank">Supply- and Demand- Constrained Process </a>
Based on Littleâ€™s Law, this simulator demonstrates how inventory levels (or service backlogs) change when the supply and demand flow rates are not aligned.
